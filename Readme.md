This is our first project involving html, css, & and javascript. With it, we hope to get the gist of how a website works with all the above three. WISH US LUCK :D

The restaurant is small eatery with a simple menu. The restaurant will offer fast food. Apart from fast foods, we also offer breakfast, lunch, and delicious dinner. With our restaurant, you can reserve a table.
